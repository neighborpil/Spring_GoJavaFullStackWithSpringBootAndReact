#### What is react dom and react native?
 - react dom can build web applications   
 - react native can build android or ios applications

### Function component
 - much simpler than class component

```
function ThirdComponent() {
  return (
    <div className="thirdComponent">
      ThirdComponent
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Class component
 - complex than function component but has some features
```

class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div className="App">
        My Hello World!
        <FirstComponent></FirstComponent>
        <SecondComponent></SecondComponent>
        <ThirdComponent></ThirdComponent>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

```
